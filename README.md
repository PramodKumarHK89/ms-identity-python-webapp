# Integrating Microsoft Identity Platform with a Python web application

## About this sample

> This sample is also available as a quickstart for the Microsoft identity platform:
[Quickstart: Add sign-in with Microsoft to a Python web app]("https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-v2-python-webapp")

### Overview

This sample demonstrates a Python web application that signs-in users with the Microsoft identity platform and calls the Microsoft Graph.

1. The python web application uses the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) to obtain a JWT access token from the Microsoft identity platform (formerly Azure AD v2.0):
2. The access token is used as a bearer token to authenticate the user when calling the Microsoft Graph.

### Scenario

This sample shows how to build a Python web app using Flask and MSAL Python,
that signs in a user, and get access to Microsoft Graph.
For more information about how the protocols work in this scenario and other scenarios,
see [Authentication Scenarios for Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-authentication-scenarios).

## How to run this sample

To run this sample, you'll need:

> - [Python 2.7+](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2713/) or [Python 3+](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-364/)
> - An Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant. For more information on how to get an Azure AD tenant, see [how to get an Azure AD tenant.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant)


### Step 1:  Clone or download this repository

From your shell or command line:

```Shell
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-python-webapp.git
```

or download and extract the repository .zip file.

> Given that the name of the sample is quite long, you might want to clone it in a folder close to the root of your hard drive, to avoid file name length limitations when running on Windows.


### Step 2: Register the service app

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the **Azure AD** service.
1. Select the **App Registrations** blade on the left, then select **New registration**.
1. In the **Register an application page** that appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `ms-identity-javascript-tutorial-c3s1-api`.
   - Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**.
1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. In the app's registration screen, find and note the **Application (client) ID**. You use this value in your app's configuration file(s) later in your code.
1. Select **Save** to save your changes.
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **Expose an API** blade to the left to open the page where you can declare the parameters to expose this app as an Api for which client applications can obtain [access tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens) for.
The first thing that we need to do is to declare the unique [resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow) URI that the clients will be using to obtain access tokens for this Api. To declare an resource URI, follow the following steps:
   - Click `Set` next to the **Application ID URI** to generate a URI that is unique for this app.
   - For this sample, accept the proposed Application ID URI (api://{clientId}) by selecting **Save**.
1. All Apis have to publish a minimum of one [scope](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow#request-an-authorization-code) for the client's to obtain an access token successfully. To publish a scope, follow the following steps:
   - Select **Add a scope** button open the **Add a scope** screen and Enter the values as indicated below:
        - For **Scope name**, use `access_as_user`.
        - Select **Admins and users** options for **Who can consent?**
        - For **Admin consent display name** type `ms-identity-javascript-c3s1-api`
        - For **Admin consent description** type `Allows the app to access ms-identity-javascript-tutorial-c3s1-api as the signed-in user.`
        - For **User consent display name** type `Access ms-identity-javascript-c3s1-api`
        - For **User consent description** type `Allow the application to access ms-identity-javascript-tutorial-c3s1-api on your behalf.`
        - Keep **State** as **Enabled**
        - Click on the **Add scope** button on the bottom to save this scope.
1. On the right side menu, select the `Manifest` blade.
   - Set `accessTokenAcceptedVersion` property to **2**.
   - Click on **Save**.

#### Step 3: Configure the service app to use your app registration

Open the project in your IDE (like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code) to configure the code.

> In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

1. Open the `config.json` file under `API` folder.
1. Find the key `clientID` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of the `ms-identity-javascript-tutorial-c3s1-api` application copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the key `tenantID` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant ID.
1. Find the key `audience` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of the `ms-identity-javascript-tutorial-c3s1-api` application copied from the Azure portal.

### Step 4:  Register the sample(UI) application with your Azure Active Directory tenant

#### Choose the Azure AD tenant where you want to create your applications

As a first step you'll need to:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account or a personal Microsoft account.
1. If your account is present in more than one Azure AD tenant, select your profile at the top right corner in the menu on top of the page, and then **switch directory**.
   Change your portal session to the desired Azure AD tenant.

#### Register the Python Webapp (python-webapp)

1. Navigate to the Microsoft identity platform for developers [App registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) page.
1. Select **New registration**.
1. When the **Register an application page** appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `python-webapp`.
   - Change **Supported account types** to **Accounts in this organizational directory only (pramkumlab only - Single tenant)**.
   - In the Redirect URI (optional) section, select **Web** in the combo-box and enter the following redirect URIs: `http://localhost:5001/getAToken`.
1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. On the app **Overview** page, find the **Application (client) ID** value and record it for later. You'll need it to configure the Visual Studio configuration file for this project.
1. Select **Save**.
1. From the **Certificates & secrets** page, in the **Client secrets** section, choose **New client secret**:

   - Type a key description (of instance `app secret`),
   - Select a key duration of either **In 1 year**, **In 2 years**, or **Never Expires**.
   - When you press the **Add** button, the key value will be displayed, copy, and save the value in a safe location.
   - You'll need this key later to configure the project in Visual Studio. This key value will not be displayed again, nor retrievable by any other means,
     so record it as soon as it is visible from the Azure portal.
1. Select the **API permissions** section
   - Click the **Add a permission** button and then,
   - Ensure that the **Microsoft APIs** tab is selected
   - In the *Commonly used Microsoft APIs* section, click on **Microsoft Graph**
   - In the **Delegated permissions** section, ensure that the right permissions are checked: **User.ReadBasic.All**. Use the search box if necessary.
   - Select the **Add permissions** button
1. In the app's registration screen, click on the **API Permissions** blade in the left to open the page where we add access to the APIs that your application needs.
    - Click the **Add a permission** button and then,
    - Ensure that the **My APIs** tab is selected.
    - In the list of APIs, select the API that you've just registered, i.e. `ms-identity-javascript-tutorial-c3s1-api`.
    - In the **Delegated permissions** section, select the **access_as_user** in the list. Use the search box if necessary.
    - Click on the **Add permissions** button at the bottom.

### Step 5:  Configure the sample to use your Azure AD tenant

In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

#### Configure the pythonwebapp project

> Note: if you used the setup scripts, the changes below may have been applied for you

1. Open the `app_config.py` file
1. Find the app key `Enter_the_Tenant_Id_here` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant name.
1. Find the app key `<API_Client_Id>` and replace the existing value with your API app id.
1. You saved your application secret during the creation of the `python-webapp` app in the Azure portal.
   Now you can set the secret in environment variable `CLIENT_SECRET`,
   and then adjust `app_config.py` to pick it up.
1. Find the app key `Enter_the_Application_Id_here` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of the `python-webapp` application copied from the Azure portal.


### Step 6: Run the sample

## Running the API

```console
    cd ms-identity-javascript-tutorial
    cd 3-Authorization-II/1-call-api
    cd API
    npm start
    cd ..
    cd SPA
    npm start
```
## Running the UI
- You will need to install dependencies using pip as follows:
```Shell
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run app.py from shell or command line. Note that the host and port values need to match what you've set up in your redirect_uri:

```Shell
$ flask run --host localhost --port 5001
```
